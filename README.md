# SDN-Algorithm-Development

**Objective:**  
Developed and implemented algorithms for Traffic Engineering and Quality of Service (QoS) in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

## Key Contributions:

- **Routing Algorithm Optimization:**  
  Designed and optimized routing algorithms to improve network traffic distribution and prevent congestion.

- **Security Implementation:**  
  Implemented security measures including device, user, and API authentication, as well as data encryption in transit and at rest.

- **Machine Learning for QoS:**  
  Applied machine learning techniques for behavioral flow analysis to enhance QoS based on application-specific requirements.

- **Network Resilience:**  
  Conducted periodic re-evaluations and continuous path optimization to ensure network resilience and efficiency.
