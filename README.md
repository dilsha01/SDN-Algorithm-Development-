# SDN-Algorithm-Development
SDN Algorithm Development Project</br>

Objective: Developed and implemented algorithms for Traffic Engineering and Quality of Service (QoS) in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).</br>

Key Contributions:</br>
Designed and optimized routing algorithms to improve network traffic distribution and prevent congestion.</br>
Implemented security measures including device, user, and API authentication, as well as data encryption in transit and at rest.</br>
Applied machine learning techniques for behavioral flow analysis to enhance QoS based on application-specific requirements.</br>
Conducted periodic re-evaluations and continuous path optimization to ensure network resilience and efficiency.</br>
